# Instructions for PACT 2024 artifact evaluation

Source the environment script for setting the path to RISC-V toolchain. Note that the paths for the toolchain in the script correspond to the default paths in the ESP docker image, and might be different from your installation path.
```
source ./esp_env.sh
```

Set `ESP_ROOT` to the path of your ESP repository. For example,
```
export ESP_ROOT=../../../
```

Source the test generation script to generate the executables for all the tests required in the PACT artifact.
```
source ./mozart_generate_all_tests.sh
```
The `audio-*.exe` files are generated in the current directory that need to be stored in the `socs/audio-mono-*-xilinx-vcu118-xcvu9p/test` folders before running `make linux`. Pre-compiled reference binaries are included in the ESP repository itself.

# Audio Pipeline

Part of [ILLIXR](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR), the Illinios Extended Reality testbed. The audio pipeline is responsible for both recording and playing back spatialized audio for XR.

# Setup Instructions

Clone this repo using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ILLIXR/audio_pipeline.git --recursive`

The audio pipeline relies upon C++17, so clang 5.0+ is required. If you are using a relatively new OS such as Ubuntu 18.04 or later, `sudo apt-get install clang` should suffice. If you're on an older OS, you can install the latest version of clang by following the steps on the [LLVM nightly packages page](https://apt.llvm.org/). If you already have clang 3.8+ and would not like to upgrade, you can replace `-std=c++17` with `-std=c++1z` in the Makefile.

Build debug: `make` or `make solo.dbg.exe`

Build release: `make solo.opt.exe`

**If you are switching between builds, please do `make deepclean`.**

Also note that the release build (-O3) is considerably faster than the debug build.

# Usage

`./solo.dbg.exe <number of 1024-sample-blocks to process> [optional: decode/encode]`

1. Number of audio blocks to process is a required parameter.
2. decode/encode specifies the different audio processing steps, which are specificially designed for profiling. No output would be generated.

If encode or decode is not specified, the code will perform both encoding and decoding on a preset input sound sample file, and output spatialized audio output in `output.wav`.

## Examples:

This will generate ~11 seconds of spatialized audio using the two sound samples under `./sample/`: `./solo.dbg.exe 500`

This will encode 2000 1024-sample-blocks of audio into HOA format: `./solo.dbg.exe 2000 encode`

This will decode (binauralize) 2000 1024-sample-blocks of encoded HOA audio: `./solo.dbg.exe 2000 decode`

**Note:** The input and output are hardcoded to be 48 KHz sample rate, 16-bit PCM wav files. If you want to hear the output sound, limit the number of processed sample blocks so that the output is not longer than input! Otherwise, garbage sound samples would be generated.

# ILLIXR integration

`audio_pipeline` subscribes to the most recent pose, does ambisonics encoding, spatial zoom and
rotation according to the pose, ambisonics decoding and binauralization to output a block of 1024
sound samples each time at 48000 Hz sample rate. Therefore it has a 21.3ms period to process each
block. If it misses a deadline, it keeps doing its current work for the next deadline.

Currently this component is for profiling purpose only. It does read a pose from illixr, but the
pose is not used by spaitial zoom and rotation. Performance-wise, the audio pipeline is input
invariant.

This component uses the logger to record its runtime.

## Event streams

- Aysnchronously reads `fast_pose`

# Components

## libspatialaudio

Submodule libspatialaudio provides the backend library for Ambisonics encoding, decoding, rotation, zoom, and binauralization (HRTF included).

## audio pipeline code

### sound.cpp

Describes a sound source in the ambisonics sound-field, including the input file for the sound source and its position in the sound-field.

### audio.cpp

Encapsulate preset processing steps of sound source reading, encoding, rotating, zooming, and decoding.
